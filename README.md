dogey.js
========

Pass a container element to dogey.js it'll read the text and add new "doge words" to the page for you

Say you have a container like so

   <div class="container">
     <p>you fuckin' what mate, I'll shiv you.</p>
   </div>
  
You can use dogey.js like so

	$(".container").dogey();
